running
--------
A web server is currently required to serve LZX autoincludes, as it satisfies the same-origin policy. Any simple web server will do, here's a one liner that works in most cases:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Once the server is running, visit [http://localhost:8000/data.html]()

building
--------
This is only required when editing the coffeescript core.

    coffee -j layout.js -mo ./ -cw *.coffee
